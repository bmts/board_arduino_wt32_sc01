    "long_description": "WT32-SC01 is a development board for visual touch screen. The board is equipped with self-developed GUI platform firmware and supports graphics drag-and-drop programming to help users complete the development of customized control platforms. The main control of the WT32-SC01 development board adopts the ESP32-WROVER-B module, which is a general-purpose Wi-Fi+BT+BLE MCU module with 4MB SPI Flash and 8MB PSRAM. The WT32-SC01 development board can also develop and debug functions such as buttons, voice, and camera through the expansion interfaces on both sides, which greatly shortens the userâ€™s development cycle.",
